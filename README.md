# Language Cards

Just a small site to store language flash cards.


## Development

### Build

```
grunt  # or `grunt watch` if you want grunt to rerun when changes occur
```

### Delpoy to GitHub Pages

This only commits the changes, it won't push them. That has to be done manually.

This will stash all files, including uncommited files, and pop them off the stash at the end. This process will unstage any changes that might be staged.

```
grunt deploy
```
